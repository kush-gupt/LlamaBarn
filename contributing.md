## Issues

Use GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.

For feature requests, focus on actionable, high-impact work. As an early stage product, we prioritize easy wins (clear benefits, minimal costs, no ongoing maintenance burden) and important features that matter now.

The tracker is for work that matters now, not "someday" features or wishlists. Feature requests that don't meet this bar will be closed, but can be re-opened later if needed.

## Pull Requests

Don't create PRs unless explicitly requested. Open an issue first.

Exception: Simple bug fixes (one file, obvious correctness, no architectural decisions) can be submitted directly.
